        Successufully defended!
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">31 Jul 2020</span>

    <p>Today I successfully defended my dissertation “Enabling and Improving Centralized Control in Network and Cyber-Physical Systems: An Application-Driven Approach”!</p>

<p>“Cloud providers and carriers are actively adopting a centralized control paradigm, as in Software-Defined Networks (SDN), to achieve high flexibility and agility in network management. This paradigm allows applications (apps) to easily monitor/reconfigure network devices based on a global view. With emerging hardware (e.g., internet-of-things, autonomous/connected vehicles, smart manufacturing) and software technologies (e.g., digital twins), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) can also leverage this paradigm to improve their performance and reliability. However, to reflect rapidly emerging device capabilities and use cases, apps need to evolve constantly, which introduces new requirements for programmability, generality, and data availability. As a result, it is challenging and sometimes impossible to deploy existing SDN(-like) solutions as they are without resorting to ad hoc patches that are time-consuming to develop and hardly reusable.</p>

<p>In this dissertation, we argue that (1) it is possible to systematically address such problems without tailoring to specific apps, and (2) generalization of apps’ behaviors is key to the solutions. To support these claims, we present three systematic solutions that enable and improve centralized control in different network systems and CPS. For apps that buffer network packets during device mobility to prevent loss or reordering, we expand SDN programmability to support in-network buffering with Programmable Buffer. For apps running in a heterogeneous network, we generalize SDN traffic management abstractions with Egret. To enable centralized control in CPS and support data-driven apps, we develop an extensible and generic framework named SDNator. We demonstrate that these solutions can not only support legacy and emerging apps but enable the innovation of new ones, while delivering high scalability and performance.”</p>

    <p>Our paper on generalizing traffic migration for different kinds of physical and virtual network functions in different use cases was accepted by CoNEXT 2019! This year there were 190 submissions and 32 acceptance.</p>

<p>Paper will be posted after camera-ready. Looking forward to meeting with other networking folks and an exciting conference!</p>

        In Memory of Professor Bi
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Feb 2019</span>

    <p>This post is dedicated to <a href="http://netarchlab.tsinghua.edu.cn/~junbi/"> Professor Bi</a> who recently passed away. I was extremely fortunate to have had the opportunity of joining Professor Bi’s lab as an undergraduate research assistant in my junior year. Back then I was a newbie to research, but Professor Bi saw my motivation and potentials and decided to put me on two of his most important projects led by his postdocs. Professor Bi gave me his full support and guidance during my stay and we eventually managed to submit two papers before I graduated. The experience I had at Tsinghua with Professor Bi was invaluable and the biggest reason I decided to and was able to become a PhD student.</p>

<p>Professor Bi works extremely hard, much harder than any of his students. Yet he’s never overly critical nor harsh on his students. I remember vividly the time I fell asleep during group meeting because I pulled an all-nighter. Professor Bi was not angry nor offended, rather, he felt sorry and urged me to get some rest. Now that he’s not with us anymore, I hope he can rest in peace. I am forever grateful and I will miss you, 毕老师.</p>

        A New Post after Two Years!
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Mar 2018</span>

    <p>Finally got down to update this site. Can’t believe it’s been over two years! So much have happened since my last post. My publication list has 8 papers now instead of 3, and my very first paper is to be presented at SOSR’18! See here for the details: <a href="papers/lin2018pausing.pdf">Pausing and Resuming Network Flows using Programmable Buffers</a>.</p>
