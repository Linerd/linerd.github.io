        In Memory of Professor Bi
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Feb 2019</span>

    <p>This post is dedicated to <a href="http://netarchlab.tsinghua.edu.cn/~junbi/"> Professor Bi</a> who recently passed away. I was extremely fortunate to have had the opportunity of joining Professor Bi’s lab as an undergraduate research assistant in my junior year. Back then I was a newbie to research, but Professor Bi saw my motivation and potentials and decided to put me on two of his most important projects led by his postdocs. Professor Bi gave me his full support and guidance during my stay and we eventually managed to submit two papers before I graduated. The experience I had at Tsinghua with Professor Bi was invaluable and the biggest reason I decided to and was able to become a PhD student.</p>

<p>Professor Bi works extremely hard, much harder than any of his students. Yet he’s never overly critical nor harsh on his students. I remember vividly the time I fell asleep during group meeting because I pulled an all-nighter. Professor Bi was not angry nor offended, rather, he felt sorry and urged me to get some rest. Now that he’s not with us anymore, I hope he can rest in peace. I am forever grateful and I will miss you, 毕老师.</p>

        A New Post after Two Years!
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Mar 2018</span>

    <p>Finally got down to update this site. Can’t believe it’s been over two years! So much have happened since my last post. My publication list has 8 papers now instead of 3, and my very first paper is to be presented at SOSR’18! See here for the details: <a href="papers/lin2018pausing.pdf">Pausing and Resuming Network Flows using Programmable Buffers</a>.</p>

        Great victory of human!
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 Mar 2016</span>

    <p>The match between Google AlphaGo and Lee Sedol didn’t go as I expected. Lee Sedol won one game back with a brilliant move at 78, a move that many consider as “God’s move”. This move led AlphaGo to a wrongful evaluation of the position, and caused it to make several big mistakes later. This is indeed a great victory of human, and is perhaps the last victory of human against machine. Nevertheless, applause and deep respect to Lee Sedol!</p>
